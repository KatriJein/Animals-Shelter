    <p>Solar power is one of the fastest-growing renewable energy sources. Photovoltaic cells, which convert sunlight directly into electricity, have become more efficient and affordable. Countries around the world are investing in large-scale solar farms to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels.</p>

    <p>Wind energy is another promising area of renewable energy. Wind turbines are designed to harness the kinetic energy of wind and convert it into electricity. Offshore wind farms, in particular, have the potential to generate substantial amounts of clean energy due to the consistent wind patterns over the ocean.</p>

    <p>Hydroelectric power has been a staple of renewable energy for decades. By utilizing the energy of flowing water, hydroelectric plants generate electricity without emitting greenhouse gases. However, the construction of dams for hydroelectric power can have significant environmental impacts on local ecosystems.</p>
